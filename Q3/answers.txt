a. I have always been passionate about development and programming. I wanted to learn how to work in a professional work environment and to work in collaboration with other people. I want to learn new ML and data science concepts, with hands-on implementation on real-life problems. At the end of 8 weeks I hope to have some industry experience and have a very steep learning curve.

b. I started Machine Learning and data science a few years back and have loved every aspect of it ever since. Its a thrill having the ability to train models that can predict virtually almost anything. Not only that I love to learn how these models are trained and work. I enjoy creating my own projects and solving day-to-day problems one may face. Processing data and bringing it to a structured format is a very satisfying process. Data science has applications in all fields, as a chemical engineering student we process enormous amount of data and use predictive models on it.

c. Spoonshot has created some great solutions in the food and beverage intelligence industry. An idea that I would love to implement is, when a person falls ill they are not sure what they are and they are not supposed to eat. This includes chronic illness as well, in the long term people often go with advice from non medical professionals or use unverifeied sources. I want to create a project that can help people in this condition. Healthy living and lifestyle is very important. From my personal experience this product could help alot of people.
